# LDO_Regulator
Designed and laid out a compact PCB that steps down +5 V to +3.3 V using a MIC5317 LDO regulator, with proper grounding strategy, trace routing, and bypass capacitors for stable and noise-free operation. 
This PCB has integrated JST-GH connectors for streamlined system integration and selected 1 ÂµF ceramic capacitors to meet stability requirements, ensuring reliable performance in electronic and embedded applications. 
This was designed as a compact voltage regulation module with a minimal footprint, designed for easy integration to streamline development and prevent voltage mismatches in both prototypes and final hardware.
